Salvatore Rosa - Keyboard Hero

Info:

-Uses Python 3.1 with Pygame 1.9.1.

-Graphics, sound, and midi are all handled with Pygame.

-Will read first loaded midi device for input.

-Uses midi note values 48 through 60.

-You can also use the computer keyboard keys q through \ (horizontally)
for playing the game.

-In the songs folder: song0.txt, song1.txt, and song2.txt 
correspond to menu choices song 1, song 2, and song 3.

-Text files are read left to right and converted into 
songs according to the following characters:

c: c note
C: c sharp note
d: d note
D: d sharp note
e: e note
f: f note
F: f sharp note
g: g note
G: g sharp note
a: a note
A: a sharp note
b: b note
o: octave of c note
x: one note pause

Game:

-When a note reaches the end of the screen or you press a 
key when a note is not in the keys hit, box you lose a life.

-Win the game by having at least one life left when all notes are depleated.

-Swap out the text files in the songs folder with your own musicial creations!

Note:

-Should work on Mac, one possible issue might be the direction of slashes when loading
sounds, images, and text files (if thats a thing). In that case you could just change the slash direction
on line 215 when loading the .txt files: 
notes = list(load_notes('songs\{0}'.format(button.tag), note_positions, note_images)), and
anywhere else as needed.

-If you download pygame make sure it is version 1.9.1 for 3.1, the midi module is broken
in the latest release.
